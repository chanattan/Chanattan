### About me

I am a CS student at ENS Rennes,
I used to develop softwares and tools related to content creation to ease a content creator's life.\
As you would notice, I am a follower of the OOP philosphy.
This philosophy is, to me, intertwined with an agent's perspective in an environment.
I like to think about cognition models and abstractions that relate to the human mind,
multi-agents systems are my topic of heart. Either from economic and social viewpoints,
I believe getting closer to a certain genuine artifical intelligence this way.

This is my last official multi-agent system project conducted at INSA Lyon CITI lab - Inria Lyon about pedestrians movements:<br>

Another multi-agent project about climate negotiations present elsewhere:<br>
